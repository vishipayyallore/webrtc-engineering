# S.M.A.R.T. Prompt Framework for GitHub Copilot Coding Agents

**Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch Edition** - Framework for creating high-quality coding agent instructions aligned with ML algorithm implementation best practices and educational standards.

---

## 🎯 **The S.M.A.R.T. Framework**

Use this framework to create highly effective coding agent instructions:

```text
S - Specific Role Definition (ML Engineer, Algorithm Specialist, Data Scientist, etc.)
M - Mission-Critical Requirements (What must be accomplished with measurable outcomes)
A - Audience-Aware Communication (Team expertise level, mathematical maturity, domain context)
R - Response Format Control (Code structure, algorithm patterns, documentation style)
T - Task-Oriented Constraints (Technology stack, implementation patterns, forbidden actions)
```

---

## 🏛️ **ML Algorithm System Alignment**

When creating prompts, consider:

- **Algorithm Type**: Is this supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement learning?
- **Use Case Context**: What task type (classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction)?
- **Implementation Approach**: From-scratch implementation, optimization, or educational demonstration?
- **Template Reusability**: Can this prompt be templated for reuse across similar algorithms?

## 🚨 **Critical Constraint Guidelines**

### **Framework/Package Versions:**

```markdown
- 🚨 CRITICAL: Use Python 3.12+ ONLY - DO NOT downgrade
- 🚨 CRITICAL: Use NumPy, SciPy, Pandas latest stable versions - DO NOT downgrade
- ❌ DO NOT use scikit-learn for core algorithm logic (only for comparison/validation)
- ❌ DO NOT modify pyproject.toml to downgrade packages
```

### **File Modification Boundaries:**

```markdown
- ❌ DO NOT modify [specific files]
- ✅ ONLY modify [allowed areas]
```

### **Build Requirements:**

```markdown
When implementing algorithms, use: python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv sync
Ensure all code follows project standards (PEP 8 for Python)
All algorithms must be implemented from scratch (no direct library usage for core logic)
```

## ✅ **Effective Instruction Patterns**

### **DO - Be Specific and Explicit:**

- ✅ "Implement Linear Regression from scratch using gradient descent optimization"
- ✅ "Create KMeans clustering algorithm with proper centroid initialization and convergence checking"
- ✅ "Fix the cost function calculation in logistic_regression.py - verify mathematical correctness"

### **DON'T - Be Vague:**

- ❌ "Fix the algorithm"
- ❌ "Make it work"
- ❌ "Update the code"

## 📝 **Constraint Language Examples**

### **Strong Constraint Language That Works:**

```markdown
🚨 ABSOLUTELY DO NOT use scikit-learn's LinearRegression class for the core implementation.

The following packages MUST remain at their current versions:
- numpy: Latest stable version
- scipy: Latest stable version
- pandas: Latest stable version

CRITICAL: Algorithm must be implemented from scratch using only NumPy for numerical operations.
```

### **Weak Language That Doesn't Work:**

```markdown
Please try to maintain Python 3.12+ compatibility
Prefer keeping current package versions
```

## 🎯 **Advanced Prompt Design Patterns**

### **Multi-Layered Prompt Architecture:**

```markdown
SYSTEM LAYER:
You are a [Specialist Role] with expertise in [Technology Stack] and [Domain Expertise].

CONTEXT LAYER:
[Project context, current situation, learning objectives]

TASK LAYER:
[Specific implementation task with clear deliverables]

SPECIFICATION LAYER:
[Detailed technical requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria]
```

### **Conditional Logic for Complex Scenarios:**

```markdown
LOGIC FRAMEWORK:
IF algorithm_type == "supervised_classification":
THEN approach: Implement from scratch with proper loss function
AND include: Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)

ELIF algorithm_type == "unsupervised_clustering":
THEN approach: Implement distance-based clustering with proper initialization
AND include: Visualization of cluster results

ELIF algorithm_type == "reinforcement_learning":
THEN approach: Implement value-based or policy-based method
AND include: Environment simulation and training loop
```

## 📊 **Output Format Control**

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

### **Agent is working correctly when:**

- ✅ It acknowledges constraints explicitly
- ✅ It asks clarifying questions about mathematical foundations
- ✅ It maintains from-scratch implementation approach
- ✅ It focuses on algorithm correctness, not just functionality
- ✅ It provides detailed progress updates
- ✅ It includes proper mathematical documentation

### **Agent needs restart when:**

- ❌ It immediately uses library implementations for core logic
- ❌ It ignores mathematical correctness requirements
- ❌ It ignores explicit constraints
- ❌ It breaks from-scratch implementation principle
- ❌ It takes overly broad approach to simple problems

## 🔄 **Agent Restart Protocol**

### **When to restart the coding agent:**

- Agent uses library implementations instead of from-scratch code
- Agent breaks mathematical correctness
- Agent modifies forbidden files
- Agent ignores explicit constraints
- Agent takes wrong implementation approach

### **How to restart:**

1. Close current pull request
2. Create new pull request with more explicit constraints
3. Include specific examples of what went wrong
4. Add stronger constraint language
